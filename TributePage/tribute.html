            <p id="tribute-info">Hidetaka Miyazaki(age 44-46) is a japanese video game director, designer, writer and
                company president of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FromSoftware" target="_blank">
                    FromSoftware</a>. He originally joined them in 2004 as a game designer for the Armored Core series,
                and soon became internationally known for directing the Souls series, starting with Demon's Souls in
                2009. Other notable games he has directed include Bloodborne and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice.</p>
        </div>
        <h2 class="secondary-title">Career</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>After graduating from Keio University with a degree in social science, Miyazaki went to work doing
                account managing for the U.S. based Oracle Corporation. Upon a friend's recommendation, Miyazaki began
                playing the 2001 video game Ico, causing him to consider a career change to a game designer. At age 29
                however, Miyazaki found that few game companies would employ him, with one of the few being
                FromSoftware, where Miyazaki began working as a game planner on Armored Core: Last Raven in 2004,
                joining the game's development halfway through. Miyazaki later directed the development of Armored Core
                4 and its direct sequel, Armored Core: For Answer.</p>

            <p>Upon learning about what later became Demon's Souls, Miyazaki became excited at the prospect of a fantasy
                action role-playing game and offered to help. The project, up until Miyazaki was assigned to it, was
                considered a failure by the company, with Miyazaki stating "I figured if I could find a way to take
                control of the game, I could turn it into anything I wanted. Best of all, if my ideas failed, nobody
                would care – it was already a failure." Although the game was received negatively at the 2009 Tokyo Game
                Show and sold far under expectations upon release, it began to pick up after a few months and soon found
                publishers willing to release the title outside of Japan. After the release and success of the game's
                spiritual successor Dark Souls in 2011, Miyazaki was promoted to the position of company president in
                May 2014.</p>

            <p>After the release of the Prepare to Die edition of Dark Souls in August 2012, Sony Computer Entertainment
                approached FromSoftware concerning cooperative development on a new title. Miyazaki asked about the
                possibility of developing a game for eighth-generation consoles, and the concept of Bloodborne developed
                from there. There were no story or setting connections to FromSoftware's previous titles, even though
                Miyazaki conceded that it "carries the DNA of Demon's Souls and its very specific level design".
                Development ran parallel to that of Dark Souls II, which Miyazaki simply supervised as he was unable to
                direct both titles simultaneously.</p>

            <p>After the release of Bloodborne in March 2015, Miyazaki returned to the Souls series as the director on
                Dark Souls III, with assistance from Steel Battalion: Heavy Armor and Dark Souls II lead directors Isamu
                Okano and Yui Tanimura, respectively. The title was released in Japan in March 2016, and worldwide the
                next month. In April 2016, Miyazaki revealed that he and FromSoftware were working on a new intellectual
                property, unrelated to the Souls series, which he wanted to personally move away from. The game was
                later revealed to be Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, which will be released in March 2019. Miyazaki also
                directed the 2018 PlayStation VR game, Déraciné, with his intended goal for it being to recreate the
                classic first-person adventure game genre in virtual reality. At the 2018 Golden Joystick Awards
                ceremony, he was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award for his contributions to the video game
                industry. The award was presented to him by Ian Livingstone and Steve Jackson, two of his design
                influences.</p>
