                <p>
                    HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is not a programming language; it is a markup language used to tell
                    your browser how to structure the web pages you visit. It can be as complicated or as simple as the
                    web developer wishes it to be. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose,
                    wrap, or mark up different parts of the content to make it appear or act a certain way. The
                    enclosing tags can make a bit of content into a hyperlink to link to another page on the web,
                    italicize words, and so on. For example, take the following line of content:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <code>My cat is very grumpy</code>
                </p>
                <p>If we wanted the line to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in
                    a paragraph (p) element:</p>
                <p>
                    <code>
                <xmp>
                  <p>My cat is very grumpy</p>
                </xmp>
              </code>
                </p>
            </article>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Anatomy_of_an_HTML_element">
            <header>Anatomy of an HTML element</header>
            <article>
                <p>
                    Let's explore our paragraph element a bit further:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <code>
                <xmp>
                  <p>My cat is very grumpy</p>
                </xmp>
              </code>
                </p>
                <p>The main parts of our element are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening
                        and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in
                        this case where the start of the paragraph is.</li>
                    <li>The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash
                        before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the end of the
                        paragraph is. Failing to include a closing tag is a common beginner error and can lead to
                        strange results.</li>
                    <li>The content: This is the content of the element, which in this case is just text.</li>
                    <li>The element: The opening tag plus the closing tag plus the content equals the element.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Attributes">
            <header>Attributes</header>
            <article>
                <p>Elements can also have attributes, which look like this:</p>
                <p>
                    <code>
                <xmp>
                  <p class="editor-note">My cat is very grumpy</p>
                </xmp>
              </code>
                </p>
                <p>Attributes contain extra information about the element that you don't want to appear in the actual
                    content. In this case, the class attribute allows you to give the element an identifying name, that
                    can be used later to target the element with style information and other things.</p>
                <p>An attribute should have:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute, if the element already has
                        one or more attributes).</li>
                    <li>The attribute name, followed by an equal sign.</li>
                    <li>An attribute value, with opening and closing quote marks wrapped around it.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>

            <article>
                <p>That wraps up the basics of individual HTML elements, but they aren't very useful on their own. Now
                    we'll look at how individual elements are combined to form an entire HTML page:</p>
                <p>
                    <code>
                <xmp>
                  <!DOCTYPE html>
                  <html>
      
                  <head>
                    <meta charset="utf-8">
                    <title>My test page</title>
                  </head>
      
                  <body>
                    <p>This is my page</p>
                  </body>
      
                  </html>
                </xmp>
              </code>
                </p>
                <p>Here we have:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        < !DOCTYPE html>: The doctype. In the mists of time, when HTML was young (about 1991/2),
                            doctypes were meant to act as links to a set of rules that the HTML page had to follow to be
                            considered good HTML, which could mean automatic error checking and other useful things.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        < html>
                            < /html>: The < html> element. This element wraps all the content on the entire page, and is
                                    sometimes known as the root element.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        < head>
                            < /head>: The < head> element. This element acts as a container for all the stuff you want
                                    to include on the HTML page, that isn't the content you are showing to your page's
                                    viewers. This includes things like keywords and a page description that you want to
                                    appear in search results, CSS to style our content, character set declarations, and
                                    more.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        < meta charset="utf-8">: This element specifies the character set for your document to UTF-8,
                            which includes most characters from the vast majority of human written languages.
                            Essentially, it can now handle any textual content you might put on it. There is no reason
                            not to set this, and it can help avoid some problems later.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        < title>
                            < /title>: The < title> element. This sets the title of your page, which is the title that
                                    appears in the browser tab the page is loaded in, and is used to describe the page
                                    when you bookmark/favorite it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        < body>
                            < /body>: The < body> element. This contains all the content that you want to show to web
                                    users when they visit your page, whether that's text, images, videos, games,
                                    playable audio tracks, or whatever else.
                    </li>

            <header>Entity references: Including special characters in HTML</header>
            <article>
                <p>In HTML, the characters <,>,",' and & are special characters. They are parts of the HTML syntax
                        itself, so how do you include one of these characters in your text? For example, if you really
                        want to use an ampersand or less-than sign, and not have it interpreted as code.</p>

                <p>We have to use character references — special codes that represent characters, and can be used in
                    these exact circumstances. Each character reference is started with an ampersand (&), and ended by a
                    semicolon (;).</p>
            </article>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="HTML_comments">
            <header>HTML comments</header>
            <article>
                <p>In HTML, as with most programming languages, there is a mechanism available to write comments in the
                    code — comments are ignored by the browser and are invisible to the user, and their purpose is to
                    allow you to include comments in the code to say how your code works, what the different parts of
                    the code do, and so on. This can be very useful if you return to a code base that you've not worked
                    on for a long time, and can't remember what you did — or if you hand your code over for someone else
                    to work on.</p>
                <p>To turn a section of HTML content into a comment, you need to wrap it in the special markers < !--
                        and -->, for example:</p>
                <p>
                    <code>
                <xmp>
                  <p>I'm not inside a comment</p>
      
                  <!-- <p>I am!</p> -->
                </xmp>
              </code>
